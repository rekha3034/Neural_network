**Handwritten Digits Classification using Neural Network**

To build a simple yet effective model to recognize handwritten digits using Tensorflow, constructing a simple neural network model using the Sequential API in TensorFlow. 
Datasource: Using TensorFlow (tf) to load the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a collection of 28Ã—28-pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9). This dataset is commonly used for training and testing machine learning models.
The neural network was first created using just input and output layers. Then a hidden layer was added to improve the performance of neural network model. The model was compiled using the Adam optimizer, sparse categorical crossentropy loss function, and accuracy as the metric. Compilation is a necessary step before training the model, where the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metric are specified.
